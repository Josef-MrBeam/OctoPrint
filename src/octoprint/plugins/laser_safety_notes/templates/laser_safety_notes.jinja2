            <strong>Heads up! Read the following, it is very important for your and other's health!</strong>
        </p>
        <h3>
           Laser Classification:
        </h3>
        <p>
			Your laser engraver contains a 658nm or 445nm laser diode with an output power greater than 1000mW. 
			According to IEC60825 this is a class 4 laser which is capable of causing injury to both 
			the eye and skin and will also present a fire hazard if sufficiently high output powers are used.  
        </p>

		<h3>Safety Advisory:</h3>
        <p>
			Laser products emit intense laser light that can be harmful to the eyes and can cause burning by irradiation.<br/>
			NEVER DIRECT AT THE EYES EVEN AT A DISTANCE REGARDLESS OF LASER CLASS!<br/>
			Everybody in the line of sight must wear appropriate laser safety glasses during the laser operation. <br/>
			Even when wearing laser safety glasses, <strong>never ever</strong> look direct into the laser beam.<br/>
			Be always responsible regarding yourself and others.<br/>
			Always operate your own assembly of the kit under permanent supervision. <br/>
			<strong>Never</strong> leave the device unattended during operation. <br/>
			<strong>Never</strong> put reflecting or mirroring or flammable materials under the laser. <br/>
			<strong>Never</strong> put the machine on a flammable surface. <br/>
			It must be operated only by persons who are aware of the risks and dangers of the operation, 
			especially those of class 4 laser light emissions.<br/>
			If not operated by yourself introduce the operating person carefully and responsibly.
			If you are connecting the laser engraver to a network ensure that you properly set up the network access 
			as well as the machines access control. Do NOT underestimate the risk of an unsecured access from the internet to your laser engraver. 
        </p>
		
        <p>
			By proceeding you are agreeing, that
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>You understand that laser components are dangerous</li>
			<li>You understand that you are responsible to build your machine according to your local regulations. 
			  This may require extensions or alterations of the design and the construction.</li>
			<li>You will always use the provided laser in a safe and responsible manner and for a legal purpose.</li>
			<li>You are legally responsible for the use and also the improper use of your Mr Beam assembly.</li>
			<li>You are legally responsible to grant access to your laser engraver only to introduced and authorized personnel.</li>
			<li>You have connected the laser engraver to a trustful network and ensured that only authorized and introduced personnel can access it. </li>
		</ul>

        <p>
			If you have any concerns about laser safety or if you do not agree with the conditions above 
			don't use this software to operate any machine emitting laser light.
